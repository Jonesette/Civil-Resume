		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>To obtain virtual employment as a civil engineer.  I am seeking wide and exciting experience as well as the opportunity to improve the world around me.</p>
		</section>
	<section class="personal-statement">
		<h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<p>I have been employed as a civil engineer for 16 years starting when I was a junior in high school.  My career began as a design drafting technician and progressed into obtaining my engineering degree, licensure as a professional engineer and on to project management and office management. </p>
		<p>My experience spans a multitude of engineering disciplines and a variety of projects.  In developing client relationships and representing my clients and my company in front of county commissioners, city councils, regulating agencies and the public, I have developed strong interpersonal and communication skills, which I can leverage for your company.  The construction contracts I have managed have given me experience in RFI issue investigation and resolution as well as limiting liability for the owner and working in changing conditions.  I am also a fast learner and will work diligently on and off the job to gain any specific knowledge I need.</p>
